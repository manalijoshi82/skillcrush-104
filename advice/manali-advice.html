			<div class="first">Make sure you don't wait fot that confident moment, that right time to start offering your skills to the world. Because that perfect time will never come. You just have to jump right in to get the most benifits out of it.</div>


			<h4>Everyone was a beginner</h4>
			<div class="first">At some point, everyone was a beginner. So don't feel like you are alone and don't hesitate to ask any questions. Remember no question is a silly question.This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</div>

			<h4>Fake it until you make it!</h4>
			<div class="first">Start behaving as if you know what you got. Own up to the skills that you are learning everyday and try to sell all of the skills with confidence. Confidence wins!!!</div>
